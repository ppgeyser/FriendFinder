This is my first full stack web app. This project showcases my understanding of front and back end integration through the use of tools such as Node.js, Express.js, as well as all of the regular front end tools such as Bootstrap, Javascript, and Jquery. I also applied concepts such as routing, APIs, and GET/POST requests in order to integrate the front and back end.
